# Skill #4 - Hello Node


## I. What is Node.js?
  
- https://nodejs.org/en/
- Server-side JavaScript, built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine](https://v8.dev/)
  - V8 is highly performant, and compiles every JavaScript instruction into native instructions
- Node.js can be used to create:
  - servers
  - desktop applications (like Discord, VS Code, Brackets, etc built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
  - embedded systems (Rasberry Pi, Arduino, etc)
- Node.js runs JavaScript WITHOUT all of the browser restrictions we know and hate:
  - full OS access
  - full hardware access
  - unrestricted threads
- Other advantages:
  - can use same language (JS) on client & server
  - a massive ecosystem of libraries can be downloaded via package managers like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
    - npm allows us to discover, download and publish *packages* (aka "libraries") from https://www.npmjs.com

## II. Install Node.js
- If you are on your own computer (as opposed to a lab machine) you will need to install Node.js, as well as npm (Node Package Manager) - the installer linked below should install them both for you
  - Here's the installer link --> https://nodejs.org/en/
  - Be sure to install the LTS ("Long Term Support") version
- After it is installed, you need to verify that `node` and `npm` (node package manager) were installed. Go ahead and open up GitBash (or PowerShell, or Terminal on a Mac) and type:
  - `node -v`
  - `npm -v`
- You should see the version numbers of each application logged out

## III. "Hello Node" Demo Start

1) Create a folder named **hello** and make it your *cwd* (by `cd`ing into it)

2) Inside of the **hello** folder, create a file named **index.js**

3) Put the following code into **index.js** --> `console.log("Hello 430");`

4) Now run the code by typing `npm ./index.js` on the command line - you should see `Hello 430` log out to the console

<hr>

## IV. Add a package.json file

- Soon we will be adding a library to this app () so that we can utilize its capabilities
- **package.json** files contain *metadata* about your node project - analagous to a [C Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile)

1) Type `npm init` to launch and interactive prompt that will create a **package.json** file for us based on our answers

    - NOTE: alternatively, you can type in `npm init -y` to create a **package.json** with default values without using the interactive prompts, and then just edit the file manually

2) We will mostly go with the default values (by pressing enter), but will add values for `description`, `author`, and `keywords`

3) Here is what the file looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "hello",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "first node and npm demo",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "430",
    "week1"
  ],
  "author": "Tony",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

- Note that this files is in JSON, where the *keys* (such as "name") must be quoted strings, and the values are legal JSON data types such as strings, objects, and arrays (booleans and numbers and null are also legal)

<hr>

## V. Edit the package.json file

1) First we will test the **package.json** file by typing `npm test`

    - this runs the contents of the "test" key (under the "scripts" key) of the **package.json** file
    
2) Now we will modify the "test" key to instead log out "No tests required"

3) Now we will create a "start" key under the "scripts" key with a value of "node ./index.js"

4) Now test the start key by typing `npm start` on the command line - this should launch index.js awhich then logs out `Hello 430` to the console

5) Finally, we'll add an "engines" key to the package.json file - this is important when the app runs on Herolu, and when we use *Continuous Integration* tools like [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/enterprise-trial-install) (coming soon!)

6) What happens when you add "bad" JSON to your **package.json** file?

<hr>

## VI. Utilize a external library (aka "package")

1) Here we will utilize the *Nano ID* package, which is used to generate [UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) - docs and usage example is here --> https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid
