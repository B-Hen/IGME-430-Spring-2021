# Skill #4 - Hello Node


## I. What is Node.js?
  
- https://nodejs.org/en/
- Server-side JavaScript, built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine](https://v8.dev/)
  - V8 is highly performant, and compiles every JavaScript instruction into native instructions
- Node.js can be used to create:
  - servers
  - desktop applications (like Discord, VS Code, Brackets, etc built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
  - embedded systems (Rasberry Pi, Arduino, etc)
- Node.js runs JavaScript WITHOUT all of the browser restrictions we know and hate:
  - full OS access
  - full hardware access
  - unrestricted threads
- Other advantages:
  - can use same language on client & server
  - massive ecosystem of libraries can be downloaded via package managers like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  
 
## II. Install Node.js
- If you are on your own computer (as opposed to a lab machine) you will need to install Node.js
  - Here's the installer link --> https://nodejs.org/en/
  - Be sure to install the LTS ("Long Term Support") version
- After it is installed, you need to verify that `node` and `npm` (node package manager) were installed. Go ahead and open up GitBash (or PowerShell, or Terminal on a Mac) and type:
  - `node -v`
  - `npm -v`
- You should see the version numbers of each application logged out

2) Inside of the **hello** folder, create a file named **index.js**
