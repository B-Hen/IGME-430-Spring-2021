# Skill #4 - Hello Node


## I. What is Node.js?
  
- https://nodejs.org/en/
- Server-side JavaScript, built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine](https://v8.dev/)
  - V8 is highly performant, and compiles every JavaScript instruction into native instructions
- Node.js can be used to create:
  - servers
  - desktop applications (like Discord, VS Code, Brackets, etc built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
  - embedded systems (Rasberry Pi, Arduino, etc)
- Node.js runs JavaScript WITHOUT all of the browser restrictions we know and hate:
  - full OS access
  - full hardware access
  - unrestricted threads
- Other advantages:
  - can use same language on client & server
  - massive ecosystem of libraries can be downloaded via package managers like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
