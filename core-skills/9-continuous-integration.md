# Skill #9 - Continuous Integration with CircleCI

## I. Overview
- CircleCI is a cloud service that will *automatically* test your code whenever a change is committed to GitHub
  - This means that CircleCI will run our `npm test` script every time we push to GitHub, and email us if it fails
- Sign up for a CircleCI account (using your GitHub account):
  - https://circleci.com/signup/
- What is *Continuous Integration* ?
  - "Integrating" (merging code branches) "hurts" - and if it hurts - we should do it more often (rather than less often) and then it will end up hurting *less*
