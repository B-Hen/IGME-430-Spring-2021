# Skill #3 - Command-line Git & Cloning Repositories

## I. Recap & Overview

- Last time we learned how to deploy a PHP file to Heroku, and then connect it to a GitHub repository
- We also saw how we can make changes to that PHP file utilizing GitHub's web interface, and that these changes would be propigated to Heroku automatically (so long as we have clicked the "Enable Automatic Deploys" button in Heroku's control panel)
- Editing a file in GitHub is fine if you only have one or two small changes to make, but it's not practical if you are actively working on a code project
- Instead, we are going to review:
  - how to `clone` a *remote* GitHub repository (i.e. download a local copy of it to our PC's hard drive)
  - how to make changes to this local respository
  - how to commit these changes and `push` them back to the remote repository

## II. GitBash

- To get this done, you will need to have command line Git installed on your system, as well as a Unix Terminal emulator
- If you have a Mac:
  - you already have the Terminal application
  - head here for instructions for installing to Mac OS (note: if you have Xcode installed, then Git is already on your machine): https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
- Windows:
  - Git for Windows - https://gitforwindows.org - will install both GitBash (a terminal emulator) and command line git for you

- Below are some of the commands we'll be using in the demo

## III-A. Unix Commands
