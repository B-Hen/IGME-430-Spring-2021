# Skill #7 - Create Random Joke Web Service


- For today's skill, you will port a simplified version **random-jokes.php** (seen in [Core Skills #1](./1-client-tools-and-http-protocol.md)) from PHP to JavaScript/Node.js, and then post it to Heroku
- Here is what the "done" version looks like:
  - XXX
  - note that it returns a *single random joke*, so it is simpler than both **random-jokes.php** and the **random-number** web service from last time
- There are no notes or videos for this "skill", but here are some tips:
  - create a new folder named **random-joke** and `cd` into it
  - `npm init -y`
  - add a "start" key to "package.json"
  - create a **src** folder, and go ahead and copy over the **index.js** file from last time if you really want to, but:
    - the app will have a **random-joke** endpoint that returns JSON formatted as in the example above, and it will return a "404 - file not found" page for all other endpoints (i.e. paths or file names)
    - you MUST delete all unnecessary code
      - that means you need to delete all of the "index page" code
      - because you also don't need to parse any query parameters, you MUST delete the `querystring` include and any dependent code
      - also get rid of any `console.log()` statements
