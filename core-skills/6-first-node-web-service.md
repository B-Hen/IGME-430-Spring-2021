# Skill #6 - First Node Web Service

- Today we will learn how to build a simple [*web service*](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/webservices/what_are_web_services.htm) using Node.js, and how to pass parameters to it

## I. Overview

### I-A. Better code (slightly)

- the simple web server we created last time wasn't too special - it actually returned the SAME web page (*index*) for every request it received. This means that when the web browser also asked for a favicon, this web server also sent back the same *index* page, again! Good thing that the browser is smart enough to ignore that HTML and not instead try to create an image out of a web page!
- this time we'll actually look for the page that the client is looking for (using the `request.url`) property:
  - if the client requests a non-existent page, we'll return a "404 - file not found" page
- we will also look for *query parameters* - in this case one named `max` that will get passed in like this - `http://localhost:3000/getRandom?max=10`

### I-B. New (to us) built-in Node.js modules
- last time we will used the `http` module to help us build a simple web server
  - https://nodejs.org/api/http.html
- this time we will also use, so that we can get `pathname` and *query parameters* from the URL: 
  - https://nodejs.org/api/url.html
  - https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/querystring.html

## II. The web service
- This web service will be really exciting - and will return a random number between `0` and `max` (`max` being a query parameter that is passed in)
- First, set up the project:
  - Create a folder named **first-web-service**
  - Using a terminal program (GitBash/Powershell/Terminal) make that folder the *cwd* by `cd`ing into it
  - `npm init -y` - let's use the default values this time
  - Edit the **package.json** file:
    - under the `"scripts"` key add a `"start"` key with the value of `node ./src/index.js`
  - In the **first-web-service** folder, create a **src** folder
  - Create **index.js** and put it in the **src** folder
    - in **index.js**, add this line of code `console.log("First web service starting up ...");`
    - in the console, type `npm start` to run your script to make sure that everything is working
  - To complete **index.js**, Copy/Paste the comments and code below, then type in the rest:
   
**index.js**

```js
console.log("First web service starting up ...");

// 1 - pull in the HTTP server module


// 2 - pull in URL and query modules (for URL parsing)


// 3 - locally this will be 3000, on Heroku it will be assigned
const port = process.env.PORT || process.env.NODE_PORT || 3000;

// 4 - here's our index page
const indexPage = `
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Random Number Web Service</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Random Number Web Service</h1>
    <p>
      Random Number Web Service - the endpoint is here --> 
      <a href="/random-number">random-number</a> or <a href="/random-number?max=10">random-number?max=10</a>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>`;

// 5 - here's our 404 page



// 6 - this will return a random number no bigger than `max`, as a string
// we will also doing our query parameter validation here



// 7 - this is the function that will be called every time a client request comes in
// this time we will look at the `pathname`, and send back the appropriate page
// note that in this course we'll be using arrow functions 100% of the time in our server-side code
const onRequest = (request, response) => {
  //console.log(request.headers);
 
 
  console.log("parsedUrl=", parsedUrl);
  console.log("pathname=", pathname);
   
};


// 8 - create the server, hook up the request handling function, and start listening on `port`

console.log(`Listening on 127.0.0.1: ${port}`);
```
