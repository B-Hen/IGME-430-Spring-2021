# Skill #1 - FTP and Unix commands

## I. Overview
- Let's take one last look at `banjo.rit.edu` ...
- ... and we're going to give you a little Unix practice here
- Goals:
  - Post a PHP file to banjo using an FTP client (ex. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/))
  - Install these developer tools:
    - GitBash
    - [JSON Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh?hl=en-US)
  - `ssh` to banjo and practice a few basic Unix commands

## II. PHP stuff we already did in IGME-330

### II-A. Upload *random-jokes.php* to banjo
- Post the **random-jokes.php** file below to banjo at `yourid/430/random-jokes.php` - if you have forgotten how to post files to banjo check out this page: https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/notes/core-skills/ftp-upload-walkthrough.md

**random-jokes.php**

```php

```

### II-B. Review

- Now open it up in the Chrome web browser to be sure that it works, it should appear something like the screenshot below
- If your screenshot is not as nicely formatted as mine, go download the [JSON Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh?hl=en-US) chrome extension now
- Open up the web inspector as I have done below

## III. Discussion

- In 230/235/330, we used the banjo.rit.edu server to post web files (HTML/CSS/JS) and run simple server-side scripts utilizing PHP. Banjo has many other capabilities (via PHP and other languages) that we didn't explore such as the ability to store data on the server via SQLite, generate images via ??? and so on. With our banjo accounts we have been granted some access to the file system
