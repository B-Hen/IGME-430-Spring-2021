# Simple HTTP HW

## I. Overview

- *In this assignment, you will use Node.js to build a simple HTTP server to server HTML, text and JSON. The server will accept several different URLs and make a choice of what to return based on the URL.*
- This HW assignment walks though building an HTTP server similar to what we did in Core Skills #1-#7, and shoud reinforce much of what we covered there
- It also adds the following - we will elaborate on much of this in class:
  - rather than building a Node.js project from scratch, there is substantial start code that you will *fork* from an existing repository

## II. Tips & Hints

1) You will be ***forking*** the start code:

    - https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/Simple-HTTP-Assignment-Start
    - the **fork** button is in the upper right corner of the repository screen
    - when you fork an exisitng repository you create a copy of it in your own account
    - once you have created this new (forked) repository you can `git clone` it
    - we covered git cloning in [Skill #3 - Command-line Git & Cloning Repositories](../core-skills/3-command-line-git.md)
