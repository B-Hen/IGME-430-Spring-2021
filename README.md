# IGME-430-01 (Spring 2021)

## Mission

<blockquote>
"Students will create and deploy <i>full-stack</i> web apps that are <i>secure</i> and <i>persistent</i>, while following <i>industry standard development practices</i>"
</blockquote>
  
- *Full-stack* means that the app has both client-side and server-side components
- *Secure* means that the apps will utilize a login system, encryption, and data validation
- *Persistent* means that app data will be cached both locally and in "the cloud" so that it can be recovered by the user at a later date
- *Industry standard development practices* means utilizing common build tools and workflows (automatic server rebooting, automatic code analysis aka linting, continuous integration, transpiling et al), testing, version control, and implementing MV* software design patterns both "from scratch" and by using current popular frameworks
